First, letâ€™s talk about how Next.js handles **static assets** such as images.

Next.js can serve static files, like images, under **the top-level `public` directory**. Files inside `public` can be referenced from the root of the application similar to `pages`.

If you open `pages/index.js` in your application and take a look at the `<footer>`, we refer to the logo image like so:

```jsx
<img src="/vercel.svg" alt="Vercel Logo" className="logo" />
```

The logo image exists inside the `public` directory at the top level of your application.

The `public` directory is also useful for `robots.txt`, Google Site Verification, and any other static assets. Check out the <Link href="/docs/[[...slug]]" as="/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving"><a>static file serving documentation</a></Link> to learn more.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
